Given input file has 3 fields:

First field is name of the process.
Second field is pid(process-id) of process.
Third field is ppid(parent process-id) of process.

For a given pid your script should print parent trace 
of given process identified as parameter to the script.

e.g.
if input is

process pid ppid
init    0     0
netscape 1    0
bash     2    0
vi        3   2


and the call is
awk -f myscript.awk input1 -v p=3

then the output is

	vi->bash->init
	

p is a variable passed into the awk script
Awk script can use variable p inside the script.
