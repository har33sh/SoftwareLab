How to check your assignments: A ready demo

nothing required from you here.. just run it and see
that the wrong solution is wrong and the right one is right..
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here we have a sample problem statement

A correct solution for it    in    correct-Solutio.awk
and a wrong solution for it  in    incorrect-Solution.awk

There are two input test cases      input1    input2

Their correct outputs are also given    output1    output2

The script named checkMysolutionOnSample.sh  will compare the outputs of the script
that you want to check with ideal ones already given.



call the checker script in the following way:

./checkMySolutionOnSample.sh    correct-Solutio.awk
./checkMySolutionOnSample.sh    incorrect-Solution.awk 


everytime it will give you the output of diff command

If there is no difference report, the solution is correct for these test cases


you are free to check for your own test cases as well

The TAs will be using some hidden test cases over and above those given in the folders
