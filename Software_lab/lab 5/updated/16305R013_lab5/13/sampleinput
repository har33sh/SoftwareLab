Deep in the jungle, there lived a big group of elephants. Elephants lived in a certain place beside a pond, and did not require venturing out. There came a time, when the pond started drying up due to lack of rain for a few years. Some of the elephants met the King of the elephants, and said, Your Majesty! We do not have any more water. Some of our little ones are on the verge of death. We must find some other place which has abundant water. After thinking a while, the elephant king said, "I remember knowing a place where there is a very big lake. It must still be full of Water. Let us go there."
