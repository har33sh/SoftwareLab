A 24 year old boy seeing out from the trains window shouted
Dad, look the trees are going behind!
Dad smiled and a young couple sitting nearby, 
looked at the 24 year old’s childish behavior with pity, suddenly he again exclaimed…
Dad, look the clouds are running with us!
The couple couldn’t resist and said to the old man
Why don’t You take your son to a good doctor? 
The old man smiled and said I did and we are just coming from the hospital, 
my son was blind from birth, he just got his eyes today.
Every single person on the planet has a story. 
Don’t judge people before yoU truly know them. 
The truth might surprise YOU.
Which are You, he asked his daughter. 
When adversity knocks on your door, how do you respond? Are you a potato,
 an egg, or a coffee bean? 
Moral:In life, things happen around us, 
things happen to us, but the only thing that truly matters is what happens within us. Which one are you?
