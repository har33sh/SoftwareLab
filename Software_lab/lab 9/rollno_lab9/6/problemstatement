The input datafile named data contains 100 records.
Each record has a list of 100 integers (in our sample, it is dice throw runs).
Calculate mean, variance, standard deviation for each record.

Using Pyplot package, create the following plots

 1.  Record nos. vs. mean values 
 2.  In the same graph, plot for variance and standard deviation also.
 
Use package numpy for calculating mean,variance and standard deviation.

Use package matplotlib.pyplot for plotting the graphs.
