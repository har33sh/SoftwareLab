You are given a server which returns reverse of a given string (request) as a response.

Function ispalindrome(host,port,s)

You have to write a function ispalindrome(host,port,s)
which connects to the server using the host and port parameter and sends a string s as a request,
receives the response(reverse of the string), and returns
True or False after comparing both request and response strings

====================

Description of code:

The server script takes ip address and port number as command line arguments. 

How to run the server:
	python server.py '127.0.0.1' '5000'
Server output:
	Server started waiting for client to connect...
	Connected to host ip:127.0.0.1
	Received b'malayalam' from 127.0.0.1
	Sent b'malayalam' to 127.0.0.1
	Connected to host ip:127.0.0.1
	Received b'soccer' from 127.0.0.1
	Sent b'reccos' to 127.0.0.1



Your client.py file must also take in the server ip address, server port number and input 
string as command line arguments 

Examples:
python client.py '127.0.0.1' '5000' 'malayalam'
   ispalindrome returns True

python client.py '127.0.0.1' '5000' 'soccer'
	ispalindrome returns False
