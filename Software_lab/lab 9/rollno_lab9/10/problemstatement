You have to use the facebook api for python and write a python script which returns the first name, lastname and number of friends of a user on facebook.
==============
API Docs:
Note:- visit http://facebook-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html and 
https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/ for more information
===============

Your code needs to take access token as command line argument. 
To generate your accesstoken visit 
  https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/  
  
  click on generete token
   
  select user_friends as access permission
  

Do not embed your acess token anywhere in your code, but pass it into .py file as command
line argument in quotes 

We will be using our access token to verify your program

Ex:

python get_fb_details.py 'EAACEhaGIgZDZD......'

prints

First Name:Raj
Last Name:MN
Total Friends:419

Note: The above is not a correct access token. Use your own access token instead.
