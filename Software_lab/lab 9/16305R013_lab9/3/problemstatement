Function Lcollapse (L)

Given L, a list which contains list of strings, 
the function concats all the strings occuring
inside this list of lists into one single string 
using space as separator. 


you must use lambda expressions to define functions which are to 
be called upon inside reduce

for example

 Lcollapse ([ ["there","will"], ["be", "a", "python"], ["quiz", "next", "week."]])
 returns
 
  "there will be a python quiz next week."

Note: Use reduce function and no iteration/for statement is allowed
