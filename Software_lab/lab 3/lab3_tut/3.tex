\chapter{Mathematical formulation}

$\pi$ series by Ramanujan is as follows:

$\frac{1}{\pi} = \frac{\sqrt{8}}{9801} \times \sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} \times \frac{(4n)!}{(n!)^{4}} \times \frac{2390n+1103}{{396}^{4n}}$

$\overline{True} = False$ \\
$\underline{This \; is  \;important}$

\section{Equations with references}
\begin{equation} \label{eq}
 f(x) = x^{2} 
\end{equation}

The line defined by equation \ref{eq} is shown in the figure.

\section{Equation Arrays}

\begin{eqnarray}
a = b \\
c = d \times e
