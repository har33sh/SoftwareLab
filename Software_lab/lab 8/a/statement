Write the python code into file problem[1-5].py file inside respective problem folders.

Note: Run the createtar.sh to create submission tar file


1.  write function sort(l) to sort an input list

l is a list built from the numbers from a file

program receives one command line argument: data file name
	we will try your program on our data files

sample input file: "data1"
print the sorted list on terminal

you can implement any sorting algorithm of your choice 

as you write this on your own, you will discover various errors
 and learn python automatically... have fun





2.  write a function binsearch(l,x) 
			returns -1 if x is not found in l, 
			else it returns the number of steps that 
				were taken to reach x inside l

program receives two command line arguments: 
	data file name, 
	number to be found
assume that input file is of sorted numbers
sample file given as "data2"

call function binsearch() on 
	a list built from input file, 
	and the search key received from command line argument	

we will try your program on our data files



3. write a function column_collapse(L) 
		L is a list of lists 
		the function prints the output list

  one example:
	L = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,4,10,20], [8,1,9,10]]
	return result = [13,8,16,20,20]

  input of lists of lists comes from a file
		donot assume how many lists are there in this file
		donot assume how many iteme are there in each list
 sample file given: data3


4. Function det(M):
	return determinant of a square matrix M

  matrix is to be read from an input file
 sample input file: data4

 print the output value



5. Frequency counter: function freqcount(L)
	returns a list of counts (dictionary) of each unique 
	word in the input list L

 example:   freqcount( [ ["a", "ab", "ac"], ["ac", "ac", "a"] ])  returns
{ "a":2, "ab":1, "ac":3}
